                Hi, I'm Olga, an entry-level web developer with a passion for creating visually appealing and functional websites and applications. After completing Practicum's web development course, I gained hands-on experience with technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, React, Redux, Git, MongoDB, Webpack, and more.
                As a web developer, I value teamwork and communication, and I'm always willing to help my colleagues. I have strong interpersonal skills and I'm receptive to constructive feedback. I bring a strong work ethic and attention to detail to my work, and I'm committed to creating quality work. I'm eager to apply my skills and knowledge to a new role and grow as a web developer.
