                Hello, my name is Olga. I am a Full Stack Developer skilled in building web applications using the .NET Stack,
                React, and TypeScript. Transitioning from a procurement specialist role,
                I have learned to work effectively under high-pressure environments and meet stringent deadlines.
                I excel in fast-paced settings, constantly aiming to enhance my technical skills and adapt to new challenges.
                Currently, I am seeking a position that involves constructing complex web applications, primarily using the .NET stack.
